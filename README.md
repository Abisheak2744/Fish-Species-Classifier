Fish Species Classifier
This project aims to classify various fish species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The classifier is built using Python and utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning tasks.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to accurately identify the species of fish depicted in user-input images. Leveraging the power of CNNs, the classifier can distinguish between different fish species with high accuracy, enabling applications in fisheries management, marine biology research, and biodiversity conservation efforts.

Features
CNN Architecture: The classifier is implemented using a deep learning architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing images of various fish species, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of species.
User Interface: A user-friendly interface is provided for users to input images and obtain species classification results.
Accuracy: The classifier achieves high accuracy in species identification, enabling reliable outcomes for practical applications.
Usage
Installation: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Model Training: Optionally, train the model further using your own dataset or fine-tune the existing model.
Inference: Utilize the trained model to classify fish species from input images using the provided interface or integrate it into your own applications.
